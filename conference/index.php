		TEDxLAHS aims to share ideas that serve to benefit the community, whether it be through raising awareness of social issues, educating others on unfamiliar topics, or by giving performances that allow the audience to appreciate what their community has to offer. At TEDxLAHS, we work to provide an event that enriches the lives of the audience. We share ideas that challenge common thought, ideas that enlighten our community, and ideas that improve our world. We share <b>Ideas UnlimiTED</b>.<br /><br />

With our distinguished set of speakers and performers, we hope to provide a conference experience where the audience will explore how ideas along different paths intersect, such as artificial intelligence and art, tech startups and non-technical hustlers, happiness and high school, and social media and youth activism.
